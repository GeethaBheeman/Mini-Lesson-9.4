>## About the Project
This project demonstrates fundamental data engineering and data analysis concepts covered in the course. 

The objective of the project is to:

- Extract and query structured data using MySQL
- Perform data analysis using Python
- Visualize insights using Matplotlib
- Work with Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
- Manage version control using Git and GitHub

The project highlights how data engineers combine databases, programming, and visualization tools to transform raw data into meaningful insights.
